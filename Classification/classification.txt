-------------WELCOME TO THE CLASSIFICATION CHAPTER-------------

What is Classification?
-> The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data. In Classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups. Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog, etc. Classes can be called as targets/labels or categories. 
   Unlike regression, the output variable of Classification is a category, not a value, such as "Green or Blue", "fruit or animal", etc. Since the Classification algorithm is a Supervised learning technique, hence it takes labeled input data, which means it contains input with the corresponding output.

How we proceed with classification?
-> A classification algorithm, in general, is a function that weighs the input features so that the output separates one class into positive values and the other into negative values.

Where it is used?
-> Some examples of classification can be as:

   Industrial applications to look for similar tasks in comparison to others
   Handwriting detection applications
   Image recognition
   Video recognition
